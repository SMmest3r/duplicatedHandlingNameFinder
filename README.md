# Duplicated handling name finder, created by: SM mest3r (https://smmest3r.dev/ https://mest3rdevelopment.com/)

A simple windows and linux compatible python code that scans the handling.meta files in the cars folder. 

If the cars are scattered in your resources folder, you can also choose the resources folder when selecting a folder, but that is the less optimized solution. If the code finds a duplicate handling name, it will print the name and the location of the handling.meta files.

## Usage:
1. Open Command Prompt
2. Copy the lcoation of the main.py file
3. Use cd command in command prompt (Example: cd C:\Users\Administrator\Documents\mester_duplicatedHandlingNameFinder
4. Use py main.py command
5. Use with health! :)
